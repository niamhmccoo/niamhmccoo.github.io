        Some say he did it right there in the kitchen. The sacred power was in
        his right hand they said, when he lay it down on the ill. His address:
        11 Foxfield Road. The house was in a suburb of North County Dublin
        called Raheny. It had a lawn and a wall and a gate. They stood on the
        footpath. As many as five thousand people a week queued up outside and
        looked with their own eyes into the home of the seventh son of the
        seventh son. They wanted&#8211;<i>needed</i>&#8211;to see him, the boy with the gift from
        God: Finbarr Nolan. He had the healing touch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone knew about it. They broadcast his story on national television
        in 1970 when he was just eighteen years old and living in the Irish
        countryside in County Cavan. He grew up in a small white bungalow there
        before his family moved to the capital. His father was a police sergeant,
        his mother a housewife. On Wednesday 11th March a reporter from the telly
        travelled the couple of hours from Dublin to Cavan to interview Finbarr
        and his family.
      </p>

      <p>
        He sat there on the arm of the couch to his mothers right
        hand side without saying a word in a turtle-neck and blazer, looking
        across at the interviewer off-screen as his mother continued to speak.
        The wallpaper behind him was heavily floral. It was all filmed in black
        and white. Newsbeat, it was called, live on weekday evenings. Everybody
        watched it. He was a clear-skinned teenager, Finbarr Nolan. When she was
        pregnant with him his mother prayed &#39;let this one be a boy&#39;, and he was
        born on Thursday 2nd of October 1952.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mrs Nolan had heard of the special powers of the seventh son of the
        seventh son. Everyone else had too. According to folklore he was destined
        to cure the sick with his holy touch and when he was just three months
        old the neighbours started coming. They went to the door and asked his
        mother for his help. She sent them away. Mrs Nolan decided to wait until
        her son was at least two years old before healing anyone. Two years of
        basic infancy he had. And when he did come to be two years old he cured
        a five year-old girl; a neighbour&#39;s child who suffered from ringworm
        (rashes most often on the arms and legs &#8211; a condition that seventh sons
        of seventh sons were supposedly very good at healing). Mrs Nolan invited
        her neighbour and his daughter inside. She dipped her own hand in holy
        water and circled the puffing red spots on the sick child&#39;s skin. She
        then placed Finbarr&#39;s hand onto them. The girl was cured after just two
        visits she said. That&#39;s when she really knew.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a connection between the seventh son of the seventh son and
        worms, she explained to the man off-screen. Mrs Nolan remembered when he
        was just a boy and he brought her out into their garden. He drew a ring
        in the clay and asked her to do the same and she did. He dropped one worm
        inside of each ring with a stick. The worm in her ring crawled outside of
        the line straight away. The worm in his ring stayed inside the line for
        as long as they both crouched there looking at it. It&#39;s said that if the
        seventh son of the seventh son had healing powers, a worm would die in
        his hand almost straight away if he ever held one. Finbarr&#39;s worms didn&#39;t
        die, but he had picked them up with a stick.

      <p>
        On weekends he went to Zhivago&#39;s, a nightclub in Dublin city just off
        Baggot Street. It had a light-up dance floor. It had a bar. It had three
        space invader machines and three pool tables, one electronic skittles
        board and one self-service restaurant. It was £3 entry at the door but
        Finbarr was doing quite well for himself so he could afford it no hassle.
        He had dropped out of school at the age of sixteen to become a full time
        healer. He never officially charged anything for his sessions during the
        seventies but he did accept gifts. He had travelled to London at the age
        of just seven and went to Peckham and cured a woman of blindness (she
        cried with happiness when he cured her). It was reported that he earned
        so much money for himself in donations that year that the Irish government
        taxed him &#0163;121,971.17. He was now in his early twenties and he lived in
        Dublin. He liked partying. He liked women. He liked his Jaguar and he
        liked Zhivago&#39;s. He had long hair and a beard and word on the street was
        that he was good looking.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Finbarr was twenty-two he disliked being called a faith healer. &#39;I
        believe I have a gift,&#39; he said, &#39;something I don&#39;t pretend to understand.
        It doesn&#39;t work all the time and when it fails I can&#39;t say why&#39;. It&#39;s
        also said that he also said that he stopped using holy water during
        healing sessions because it deterred Protestants, and he got just as
        many of them showing up as he did Catholics. It&#39;s also
        said that he also said that his curing of babies and animals was proof
        enough that faith was not a requirement for being healed. Rumour has it
        he once treated a sick racehorse and straight away it went on and won
        nine races in a row.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Finbarr, it was just how he made his living. He didn&#39;t take it
        seriously he said, it was just work like. News reports say that he cured
        ringworm, cowpox, back pain, leg pain, blindness, arthritis, skin cancer,
        multiple sclerosis and stroke victims. He began making more TV appearances
        and once even cured a station manager&#39;s back pain live on radio. His
        family home became known in the newspapers as mini-Lourdes. Crowds of
        dying people flocked to the house almost every day throughout the early
        seventies. It was average-sized for a suburban family household, far too
        small to accommodate thousands of people a week so Finbarr began to rent
        out halls and hotel rooms in town and make his living from there. At the
        height of his popularity it was reported that he received &#0163;1,434.87 worth
        of donations a day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finbarr&#39;s father didn&#39;t like the attention. Finbarr bought his
        parents a new house.
      </p>

      <h5>3.</h5>

      <p>
        Hollywood they said, that was where he went. He was twenty-six years old
        when he left. It was 1978 and he had originally set out for Greece, to
        escape the crowds. It didn&#39;t work. Two thousand sick people were already
        waiting for him at the airport in Athens when he arrived. He stayed one
        night at a nearby hotel, but before he could stay a second the police
        came to him and told him that he had to leave the city. Eighteen thousand
        sick people were waiting for him in the street and it was causing a
        disruption.
      </p>

      <p>
        So he went to Cyprus. He cured a man&#39;s back-pain unbeknownst
        to the fact that he wrote for a local newspaper. The next day the
        journalist published a front page story about how the legendary seventh
        son of a seventh son Finbarr Nolan had performed a miracle on his ailing
        bones and he was cured. So he went to Amsterdam. It was there that he was
        destined to meet a well-to-do restauranteur named Dick Cami. Dick had
        heard stories about Finbarr through a friend. It was then that he seized
        an opportunity with young Finbarr and flew him to Hollywood to set up a
        new practice, and Dick paid for everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was then that Finbarr started charging for his services. $30 was the
        price per visit, and a minimum of three were deemed necessary for his
        powers to work. $50 was the price per private treatment (an essentially
        &#39;more intense&#39; experience of his powers).
      </p>

      <p>
        He went and hired three staff
        members. Vincent Marchese and Patricia Maddux and Michelle Dibble.
        Vincent was his personal representative. Patricia and Michelle ran the
        office. Business hours were between 2pm and 7pm on weekdays. On weekends
        he enjoyed the company of playboy bunnies, and in his clinic he had
        separate waiting rooms for men and women.
      </p>

      <p>
        Michelle once had sciatica and asked her boss to heal her. He didn&#39;t want
        to, he told her, it didn&#39;t work on people he knew. Michelle convinced him
        to do it anyway. Afterwards, she told one journalist, she felt so much
        better after her treatment that she went home and moved all the furniture
        round in her house. She didn&#39;t feel the pain any more she explained, aside
        from that one day after she moved all the furniture round in her house.
      </p>

      <p>
        Women admired him. Tall, slim, groomed. He had a moustache. It was the
        eighties. He was a guest on American talk shows and had a fifty percent
        success rate at the clinic. He stayed a year in Hollywood and then moved
        to Florida to open another new practice (Vincent thought he should heal
        more people who lived by the beach). And so he travelled. He travelled
        to New Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore, California, Las Vegas and Seattle
        making hospital visits. He felt that Americans were more cynical about
        his powers than Europeans were. He developed a reputation there as being
        too candid. They say he once visited a young girl in hospital whose
        parents asked him why he decided to visit. He told them that he just
        didn&#39;t have anything else to do that day, which was reportedly true. He
        didn&#39;t have anything else to do that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finbarr said he didn&#39;t think about much when he laid hands on the ill.
        His mind wandered the same as anyone else&#39;s did while they were at work.
        A soccer game, a girl he&#39;s dating, some world event. He said in all
        honesty he&#39;d rather disco than cure the sick.
      </p>

      <h5>4.</h5>

      <p>
        Finbarr had returned to Ireland by 1987 without much interest from the
        media. That summer he held a healing session in a hotel in County Wexford.
        Only fifteen people were reported to have shown up over the first three
        weeks. His popularity had waned. Normally the place would be packed he
        said, Wexford was one of the counties in which he usually did very well
        you see (along with other nearby southern counties like Waterford,
        Kilkenny and Tipperary). He assumed his session&#39;s failure was down to a
        lack of publicity &#8211; it was certainly not that Irish people were losing
        interest in him and his powers. For seventeen years after that his
        healing sessions weren&#39;t heard of. The excitement that had been
        surrounding him since birth had begun to dwindle, and it was during
        this time he wrote his memoirs. There were rumours that he went bankrupt.
      </p>

      <p>
        It wasn&#39;t until 2004 that he advertised another one-off healing session.
        This time it was to be held in an attractive seaside town in the north
        of County Wicklow called Greystones. He booked out a room in La Touche
        Hotel for a Monday and a Thursday that January. No one took count of the
        numbers that showed up for that one. Since then there has been no public
        record of the great seventh son of a seventh son Finbarr Nolan, as if
        he just disappeared. That summer La Touche Hotel closed down.
