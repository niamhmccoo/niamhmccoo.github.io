        &#39;Japan Blue&#39; was coined by an English scholar who, visiting Japan in the
        18th century, was struck by blue&#39;s overwhelming presence; from the
        archipelago to every doorway and everyone&#39;s clothes.

        This issue journeys to the Okamoto Orifu Factory where master craftsmen
        work to satisfy the world&#39;s hunger for Japanese selvedge denim, and to the
        famous Water Masters who maintain the sukumo tradition that makes
        Japanese indigo darker and more intense than anywhere in the world.

        Japan has a complex and obscure culture, and issue 81 of Selvedge
        Magazine begins to scratch the surface.
