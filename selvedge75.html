        This issue of Selvedge Magazine discovers the true benefits of work.
        From the life-saving lace of 19th century Ireland, to the revival of the
        French worker&#39;s jacket, this issue looks at how we work with fabric, and
        how it works with us in return.

        As the cost of higher education rises, we see a movement
        towards the workbench which brings us back to our past, and examine
        apprenticeship schemes set up after World War One.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the health benefits of work to its economic, social and political
        impacts, the stories in this issue arrive at America&#39;s largest mills,
        at Japanese denim and at Mourne Textiles, where a great woman&#39;s work
        is being recovered.
