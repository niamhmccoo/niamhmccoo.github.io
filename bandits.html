  <h4>Bandits Live Comfortably In The Ruins // Flat Time House</h4>
  <div class="bandits article-page">

        &#39;There is no masterplan of coherence to be had here&#39; is what the (rather
        refreshing) press release read, and it wasn&#39;t exaggerating. Curated by
        Irish artist Sean Lynch, &#39;Bandits Live Comfortably in the Ruins&#39; at Flat
        Time House is a group show that feels tenaciously disjointed, and close
        to the bone.

        There are ten artists on display. In the front room (The Mind) the first
        work that pulls you is a large flat screen TV mounted low down on the wall.
        Sitting down you feel the density of the space. The screen bombards your
        entire vision. In Fiona Marron&#39;s video &#39;After Automation&#39;, a middle-aged
        man with glasses sits in his office wearing a nondescript suit and tie.
        His desk is dark wood. Clustered on the surfaces behind him are books,
        photographs, trophies and one computer screen displaying a graph. Science
        fiction novelist and financial executive Leo Melamed speaks to an off-screen
        presence re-calling the process of writing his novel &#39;The Tenth Planet&#39;.
        He is regularly interrupted by phone-calls. His corporate surroundings do
        not cohere with the fanciful words coming out of his mouth.

        In the kitchen (The Body Event) there is a table. On it there is one
        slideshow projector and one open newspaper. The projector casts an ambient
        light on the wall: a series of ornate illustrations, petrol filling stations.
        One velvet-green with red pumps, one sandy-brown with gold pumps. One
        shaped like a palace and one shaped like a Christmas tree. They come from
        a 1990 article in &#39;Country Life&#39; magazine titled &#39;Is Banality Inevitable?&#39;
        The newspaper on the table is the &#39;Evening Standard&#39; from 1987. In it
        there&#39;s an article on BT touring their vandalised phone booths round to
        schools. They want to warn the youths you see.

        The final room (The Hand) revolves around a large architectural model of a
        hotel-casino-conference-centre from 1996. Burke Kennedy Doyle Architects
        are the ones who proposed it to be built in Dublin&#39;s Phoenix Park (but it
        never was). It&#39;s huge. It&#39;s called &#39;The Sonas Centre&#39; and &#39;sonas&#39; means
        happy in Irish. It has lots of tiny trees and lots of fake lakes. It has
        a to-scale simulation of Stonehenge, there for the suits to reflect upon.

        In the corner, documentation of Eilis O&#39;Connell&#39;s controversial public
        sculpture The Great Wall of Kinsale is arranged by glass cabinet photographs
        and old video footage. Her giant sculpture was made in 1988 from two curved
        pieces of iron sprouting from the ground and joining at the top. It was
        meant to be an entrance to a park but the park never got built. Locals
        hated it. They wanted it gone or at least improved upon. Some people
        painted it and pumped water through it. Some people used it as a bus
        shelter.

        The artists in this show negotiate the inherent monetisation of space, and
        they do it with the bodies that occupy it. John Carson shows that a stout
        company won&#39;t let you put their brand next to your drunken face. Giles
        Worsley&#39;s article shows that oil companies won&#39;t let you dress up filling
        stations with materials other than their own. Sam Keogh&#39;s burnt phones
        show that your property isn&#39;t fixed. &#39;Bandits Live Comfortably in the Ruins&#39;
        is an unnerving and idiosyncratic response to the inescapable capitalisation
        of space, and with the imminent closure of Flat Time House, the venue is
        proof in itself.
