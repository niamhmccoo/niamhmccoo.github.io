        This issue of Selvedge celebrates the material empathy of
        today&#39;s makers and designers. Since the post-war world, synthetic
        fibres were seen as saviours that would liberate us from the toil of
        laundry and the inflexibility of natural fibre.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as time passed and experience gained, breathability and
        biodegradability became increasingly important, shifting the material hierarchy
        that today&#39;s textile industry was built on.

        Issue 78 looks to the innovative work of Christien Meindertsma, the
        history of the Pennsylvania Dutch settlers, the biography of the bag and
        the state of endangered materials to find out in this issue, why
        substance matters.
