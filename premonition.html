  <h4>A Premonition of the Act // Camden Arts Centre</h4>
  <div class="premonition article-page">
    <article>
      <p>
        A low, round, revolving stage is lit from above. An audience circles it
        in tiers of a violet hue. From a darkened aisle two women walk out,
        slowly, their leotard necklines sparkling. A woman&#8211;the artist, Rose
        English&#8211;proceeds to the circle&#39;s edge dressed in a black robe. She
        holds a champagne glass on a saucer and passes it to one of the
        performers; a procession.
      </p>

        The performers revolve to the crescendos of hymning emanating from the
        darkened aisles; words like flagrant, flutter, flicker, flower, flatter,
        flame, screaming, talking, music, wisdom. The tension rises as the women
        begin to balance increasingly complicated glass structures on their feet,
        their hands, and their heads as they bend, flip, slide and roll around
        the moment that never comes: when everything blows into shards.

        Like much of English&#39;s work in her latest exhibition at Camden Arts Centre,
        watching this video my attention too revolved around two points: the
        collision, and the audience.

        Known for her theatrical performance works, &#39;the unsung queen of British
        performance art&#39;, English has been making work since the 1970s when she
        first emerged as a prominent figure from Britain&#39;s feminist art scene,
        although her new solo exhibition &#39;A Premonition of the Act&#39;, remains
        emptied of any performance in the flesh.

        In each of the two video works in the exhibition, every audience member
        on screen is shifting, grazing, watching with you. Both works document
        bygone events; &#39;Ornamental Happiness&#39; filmed at the Liverpool Biennale in
        2006, and &#39;Flagrant Wisdom&#39; filmed in what appears to be a professional
        gym, then in Sunderland&#39;s National Glass Centre where each performer
        takes a turn at rehearsing their own throwing and sliding and turning
        and balancing heavy glass vessels on their bodies. All the while their
        fellow rehearsers mimic you watching from the sidelines in a double-screened
        montage. Everyone anticipates the smash that never happens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Between these two films the largest room in the exhibition remains the
        calmest. Here, a group of chairs are clustered together in darkness
        under the sound of hymns falling from the speakers in the rafters,
        encircled again by the artist&#39;s notebook pages pinned to the faraway
        walls, almost all of them penciled with phrases like &#39;electric glass&#39;,
        &#39;synaptic circus&#39; and &#39;liquid embrace&#39;, each one spotlit in a pool of
        amber light. The room itself becomes a sanctuary from the
        adrenaline-fuelled act of the near fall, between each teetering disaster
        at either end of the gallery.
      </p>

        In the final room during Flagrant Wisdom the bystanders check their
        phones, and so do I. The tension first encountered in Ornamental
        Happiness has at this point diffused, and I pick up my bag to leave. Is
        it really possible to bottle such tension? For now, A Premonition of
        the Act is as close as you&#39;re going to get.
