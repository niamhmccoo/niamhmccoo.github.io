        I&#39;ve been guilty of it more times than I care to admit. I&#39;ve done it
        sipping a glass of wine at a friend&#39;s exhibition or sitting chatting about
        ideas in their studio: casually glazing over the more questionable parts
        of their artistic endeavours. I&#39;ve done it to be supportive to those brave
        enough to do it, to encourage art to keep being made because you never know
        when something&#39;s going to turn around and succeed in a way that really
        means something to you, even if (let&#39;s face it) this rarely happens.
      </p>

      <p>
        It did happen at Foaming At The Mouth though, the &#39;art writing&#39;
        performance event that&#39;s been popping up in pubs around Dublin (and once
        in Amsterdam) every so often over the last five years, curated by Emer
        Lynch and Tracy Hanna. I went to the latest instalment at Nancy Hands
        Bar when I was home last Christmas and (happily) paid a tenner in for
        the first time. FATM describes itself as a &#39;visual art spoken word night&#39;
        offering a platform to artists and writers and people in between to
        perform something &#8211; anything &#8211; they like, resulting in a hodgepodge
        evening of decidedly de-institutionalised literary-cum-artistic staged
        experiments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the beginning, FATM has been brilliant. Unlike other &#39;experimental&#39;
        art endeavours (MOMA&#39;s Artists Experiment initiative comes to mind), there
        is something real at stake here where participants are constantly running
        the risk of public failure in realtime &#8211; but even this key to its success
        is a contradiction, because it&#39;s not quite clear what constitutes failure
        for us outside of the gallery walls. In every iteration there have been
        both extremely rewarding performances alongside the not so rewarding,
        and this you ought to expect and value from a truly experimental event.
        Lily Cahill&#39;s and Megan Nolan&#39;s separate readings were particularly
        excellent, for example, where both personal stories felt acutely
        symptomatic of a widespread state of just getting on with things:
        beautiful and refreshing for just being there, in public, away from any
        structured cultural context.
      </p>

      <p>
        These performances were also accompanied by less pleasant ones; a gruelling,
        thirty-minute sound poetry improv, for instance, seemed to be the biggest
        test to the crowd&#39;s good nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an event that bases itself on the premise of the experiment this
        blip ought not to matter, but now as FATM has reached its eighth
        iteration, it&#39;s not really an experiment anymore, is it? It has its
        established structure, its calibre of artists (who actually get paid,
        it&#39;s important to note) and its paying customers. It&#39;s set a
        bar, which is a good thing, but this also means that it no
        longer occupies such an artsy no-man&#39;s-land for visual and literary
        creatives (i.e. the outsider&#39;s outsider, i.e. the could-not-be-more-insider
        insider). And so it comes back to our passivity masked as goodwill, the
        bad habit of the frustrating and contradictory yet wonderfully tentative
        art community. Events like this ought to be nourished, but to do so
        truly we, as an audience, have a responsibility to say when a work is u
        nsuccessful, even if just for a moment. If we don&#39;t, we may all just end
        up listening to the same song on repeat.
