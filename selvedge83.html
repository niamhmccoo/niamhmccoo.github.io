        The making of textiles is notoriously time consuming. The desire to
        speed it up has preoccupied the industry for the last 200 years, and
        cotton fibre has provided the greatest success.

        60% of all clothing is now made of cotton. After spending the last two
        centuries producing more and more of it, the biggest issue facing the
        textile industry today is how to dispose of the excess. There is much
        in the news on the environmental impact of plastic, but textile waste
        is also a big a problem, with the average garment being worn just three times.

      What can individuals do? The issue of Selvedge Magazine aims to provides the answers.
