        Lace is a lesson in contradiction. It is demure, erotic, delicate,
        brutal, cheap, sophisticated, fragile and strong. It&#39;s made with needle
        and thread; with miniature bobbins; and with cast iron looms weighing
        more than ten tons.

        In the 19th century lace instigated the Luddite riots, and catalysed the
        smuggling of looms across borders. It is also the darling of the haute
        couture fashion industry and a source of ridicule when used to shield
        prying eyes in suburban homes.

        This issue unpicks this complex material, visualising the
        working of Leaver looms, tracing its history, and examining its
        political status in the form of the veil.
