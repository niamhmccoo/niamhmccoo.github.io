        Trade winds are the prevailing wind patterns that throughout history
        have carried ships across oceans, establishing trade routes that have
        in fact changed the course of textiles forever.

        This issue of Selvedge Magazine explores the cross-pollination of ideas
        made possible by trade, from the batik villages in Pekalongan,
        Indonesia, to cotton&#39;s journey from Savannah to the port of Liverpool.

        It also looks to the east only to find traces of French tradition in
        exquisite Vietnamese embroidery, and takes a trip through France to
        discover how the country&#39;s rich textile history makes itself known today.
