        &#39;Zeitgeber&#39;: a rhythmically occurring natural phenomenon, acting as a
        cue for the regulation of circadian rhythms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Translated from German, meaning "timer" or "time-giver", the zeitgeber
        presented itself at one point and another in Hannah Fitz&#39;s latest
        exhibition "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo
        buffalo" at Broadstone Studios in Dublin. Curated by Lily Cahill & Rob
        Murphy, Fitz presented a series of sculptures that could be described in
        one dimension as a definitive collection of loop-like caricatures.
        </p>

        <p>
        Exclusively sculptural, last week Broadstone Studios housed a series of
        garishly colourful, tacky and textured artworks sitting in its long-lived
        living-like room, under the imperious title of "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo
        buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo". The exhibition comprised of a
        sequence of free-standing sculptures, most of which prevailed at what
        seems to be an increasingly familiar &#39;one-somethingth&#39; scale of an average
        human size. Made from craft-like materials such as paper, plastic, glue
        and wire, Fitz rendered sculptures mindfully imitating the appearances
        of domestic objects such as "Plant", "Bowl", and "Table". Even included
        were two figurine-like sculptures perched on the floor, all too similar
        to what might catch an eye on a stale mantlepiece. Each finished with a
        cheesy shade of gloss and shaped into a mock-up finish, the pieces on
        show resembled candid, cartoon versions of unspecified versions of
        themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        The entire exhibition coiled on itself. In a habitual turnstile, each
        piece prompted it&#39;s next iteration before taking the time to acknowledge
        its own self. Collectively, the works shared each others&#39; material roots
        and brimmed contently with such astute site-specificity that it
        pitter-pattered brightly amidst the show&#39;s otherwise evasive demeanour.
        As the carpeted air of Broadstone Studios sat heavily on the work, the
        work too permeated the space. Each was breathing into the other, as if
        to attempt a synchronization of it&#39;s own circadian rhythm. This cadence
        seemed to generate an intrinsic hinge between the chunky artworks
        themselves, and the dead space hanging in the long room with the high
        ceilings. Consequently, the work at one point heaved and began to charge
        an innate cycle for the show, causing it to trip on itself again and
        again, as you try to familiarize yourself with the exhibition. It was
        a strange lapse, that made it tricky to view one single piece at a time.
      </p>

      <p>
        As this cycle gained its momentum surrounding the plot of "Buffalo buffalo
        Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo" small embellishments of
        measured slices became attentively conspicuous. The exhibition&#39;s recurring
        materials were comparatively placed on the carpet and on each other, as
        the works grasped for themselves and their surroundings in a resounding
        stupor.
      </p>

      <p>
        The room turned to putty as the work induced a breed of veritable
        stickiness between the work&#39;s fabric and the room itself, crossing at a
        version of old and new (conceivably ruminating somewhere in the mass of
        carpet). Grabbed from behind by these property relatives, I wondered &#8211;
        for whose exemplification was this? It seems dubious to consider that a
        property might exist without an exemplifier, however if there was one
        present at this exhibition it was playing hide and seek on me.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sculptures laid lingering in their constant double-take and would
        remain that way until the exemplifier (if any) of these properties would
        come to claim them. The works had been knotting themselves in systems
        and universals from the beginning, and every so often as "Buffalo buffalo
        Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo" coincided with itself,
        the zeitgeber would appear to cue the rhythm.

        As part of Lily Cahill and Rob Murphy&#39;s residency at Broadstone Studios
        the artists invited Hannah Fitz to exhibit her work from the 14th until
        the 18th of May, and previously Ruth Clinton and Niamh Moriarty to engage
        with the Victorian era building. This series of exhibitions finished with
        &#39;Prodigy&#39; &#8211; a solo exhibition of work by Cahill & Murphy at Broadstone
        Studios, on May 28th.
